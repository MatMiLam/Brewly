Final Project

Brewly "The Brewry Finder" is exactly that, a web app that will allow users to find Breweries. My frequently traveling
father in-law always asks me about local breweries each time he travels to a new area. For me this meant searching through 
the internet looking to compile a list for him. Brewly will take care of this for him and will do a more complete job. View
all breweries in a selected state or drill down further to display the breweries in a selected city. Brewly will display 
each brewery name as well as some other useful info. Address, phone number, link to website and link to location on Google maps 
are all included. Creating an account will also enable the user to save all of their favorite breweries. These features make
Brewly very useful.
